#' Calculate healthiness Score
#' @param df_res the dataframe of the restaurant environment(count within a buffer)
#' @param  df_tot  dataframe of the restaurant environment for normalisation. By default same as the df_res
#' @param  score the healthiniess score
#' @param normalise if normalise is Ncati, normalise by the number of restaurant categotris, e.g. if there are 3 fastfood and 5 cafe, the number of categories is 2. If the normalise is Nall, then normalise by the total number of resturant, in the previous example: 8.
#' @param method method to calculate healthiness score, can be from c("simple", "expFun", â€œthreshold")
#' @details all the 0 restaurants records are NA.  if method is "simple", healthScore = sum(NumberRestau \* score). The method "expFun" calculate healthiness score with an exponential function of the number of restaurants sum(log(numberOfrestaurant+1) \* score). The "threshold" method treats more than a certain number (i.e. threshold) restaurants as the certain number of resturants
#' @example healthScore(d_res_100m, d_res_100m,score_res, "Ncati", "expFun")
